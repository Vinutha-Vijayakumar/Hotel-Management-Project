Data Analytics Project on Hotel Management Data.  1. Build a Database  2. Analyze and Retrieve Data with SQL  3. Connect Power BI to a Database  4. Visualize Data in Power BI

Constructed a database for the analysis and visualization of hotel booking data using SQL and Power BI. The dataset encompassed bookings for city and resort hotels in various 
countries for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Notably, the 2020 data is incomplete, extending only until August, making our conclusions and decisions based on data up to that point. 
However, the complete 2020 dataset is available in the dashboard.

Key findings from data analysis:

1. Is hotel revenue increasing annually?
   Our analysis indicates a consistent growth in revenue from 2018 to 2019, more than doubling during this period.

2. Should parking lot size be expanded?
   The data suggests that the parking lot is not fully utilized, implying no immediate need for an expansion.

3. What trends emerge from the data?
   An intriguing trend reveals more weekday stays compared to weekends, which is somewhat unexpected.
